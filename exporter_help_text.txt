Usage: python3 exporter.py --input [file] [[options]]

Mandatory parameters:

--input [file] Indicated the location of the zip file generated by the fake new extractor

The options are the following:

--output [file] Specifies the output file for the model (default: out.ttl)


--format [format] Specifies the format of the output serialization. You may use any of the supported formats in the rdflib package ('xml', 'n3', 'turtle', 'nt', 'pretty-xml', 'trix', 'trig' and 'nquads'; default: turtle)


--model-uri The base URI of the model (by default http://data.gesis.org/claimskg/public/)


--resolve Specifies whether to resolve the wikipedia page identifiers for TagMe annotations to DBPedia URIs. If this option is activated, the resolution is performed through SPARQL queries to the official DBPedia endpoint, which requires you to have an active internet connection. Additionally, you will need a running instance of `redis-server` as the results of the queries are cached to prevent unnecessary queries from being performed.

--threshold [float_value] If --resolve is present, specifies the cutoff confidence threshold to include a TagMe annotations as a mention. The TagMe documentation recommends a value between 0.1 and 0.3 (default 0.3)
